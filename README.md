# Simple Redux Boilerplate (with bonus React Router!)

I've tried to make this boilerplate as raw as possible, to help people start up with learning Redux. There is little-to-no extra stuff at the moment. For example, there is NO addition of redux sagas, or react router. This is really just useful for seeing what Redux is, and how it can be pretty useful for keeping track of state.

While the setup for Redux into a project can be a little annoying, once you get the thing all hooked up it's actually a ton of fun to make new reducers and have that stuff be used all over your app.

I'm going to add a couple extra things to this over the next little bit, but you should be safe with just deleting everything in the `render` for `App.js`, any unused components, and just customize this to your needs.

## React Router

In the main branch (`master`) there is a boilerplate with ONLY Redux. In the branch `redux-router` I have React Router 5 set up. Note, it has _nothing_ to do with Redux. React Router is just really useful for making nice single-page apps, so I wanted to include it in here.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run any of the stuff that you get with `create-react-app`. For example...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
